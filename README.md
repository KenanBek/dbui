# dbui

`dbui` is the terminal user interface and CLI for database connections.

It provides features like,

- Connect to multiple data sources and instances.
- List all schemas in a selected data source.
- List all tables in a selected schema.
- Preview a selected table.
- Execute custom SQL queries on a selected table or schema.
- User-friendly UI features like,
    - query execution status,
    - warning and error messages,
    - full-screen and focus modes,
    - mouse support.

#### Currently supported databases

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite (soon)

#### What's next?

- Auto-generate SQL Queries for Insert, Update, Delete.
- Save frequently used SQL Queries.
- Configurable keyboard layout.
- Autocomplete for SQL Queries.

#### Current status

- üöß Under development, expect bugs, errors, and unexpected crashes.
- üêû Bug and error reports are very appreciated.
- üì£ I highly recommend to check for periodic updates.

## Usage

### Install

#### Option 1: Brew

```shell
brew isntall dbui
```

#### Option 2: Go Get

```shell
go get github.com/KenanBek/dbui
```

#### Option 3: Source Code (+demo databases)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/KenanBek/dbui.git
cd dbui
make demodbs # runs docker containers with mysql and postgresql demo dbs

# you can destroy them by executing
make demodbs/destroy
```

Copy configuration and run:

```shell
touch dbui.yaml # check below for the content
make run
```

Copy/paste the configuration provided below for demo databases.

### Configuration

By default `dbui` uses configuration file (`dbui.yaml`).

```yaml
dataSources:
  - alias: employees
    type: mysql
    dsn: "root:demo@(localhost:3316)/employees"
  - alias: world-db
    type: postgresql
    dsn: "user=world password=world123 host=localhost port=5432 dbname=world-db sslmode=disable"
defaut: employees
```

First, it checks in the current directory, then in the user's home directory.

All provided database connections will be available in the application, and you can switch among them without restarting
the application.

Alternatively, it is possible to start `dbui` for a single database connection using a DSN (data source name) and type
arguments.

```shell
$ dbui -dsn <connection string> -type <data source type>

# example for a mysql connection
$ dbui -dsn "codekn:codekn@(localhost:3306)/codekn_omni" -type mysql
```

#### Summary of Configuration Order

```shell
# when
$ dbui
# read from `./dbui.yaml` if not then from `~/dbui.yaml`

# when
$ dbui -f /my/custom/dir/mydbui.yaml
# read from custom directory `/my/custom/dir/mydbui.yaml`

# when
$ dbui -dsn "<connection-string>" -type mysql
# init single connection mode
```

### Default Keyboard Layout

![dbui keyboard hot keys](docs/keyboard-layout.png "DBUI Keyboard Hot Keys")

#### Focus Hot Keys

- `Ctrl-A` - sources
- `Ctrl-S` - schemas
- `Ctrl-D` - tables
- `Ctrl-E` - preview
- `Ctrl-Q` - query

#### Special

- `Tab` - navigate to the next element
- `Shift-Tab` - navigate to the prev element
- `Ctrl-F` - toggle focus-mode
- `Ctrl-C` - exit

#### Table Specific

Use these keys when the table panel is active:

- `e` - describe selected table
- `p` - preview selected table (works as ENTER but does not change focus)

#### Preview Specific

Use these keys when the data preview panel is active:

- `y` - copy a selected row into the clipboard.
